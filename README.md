[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5a510ba1-96b4-4834-9a07-913dce4b5061/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lucid-nightingale-60a4e2/deploys)

**Note:** There is a bug that is fixed in the upcoming Hugo 0.76 where styles are not rebuilt when your Tailwind or PostCSS config changes. If you want that sooner you can build Hugo from source.

A very simple starter set up with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and its [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) and a build setup using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and PurgeCSS (when running the production build).


This setup can be used both as a starter project and a theme.

## As a Project

```bash
npm install
hugo server
```

## As a Theme

Import it into your project, and then run:

```bash
hugo mod npm pack
npm install
```

Then run your project as usual.
